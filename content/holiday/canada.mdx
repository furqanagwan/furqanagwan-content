# Toronto Travel Notes: A Ground-Level View

Toronto was my entry point into Canada, and it delivered across the board—from its skyline and sports culture to classic eats and nearby wonders like Niagara Falls. If you're thinking about visiting, here’s what to expect—no fluff.

:::note First Impressions
Toronto feels like a city that doesn’t slow down. From the moment I landed, it was clear this place runs at full speed. Towering glass buildings, efficient public transit, and a deep-rooted sports culture that’s hard to miss—especially when Raptors gear is everywhere.

## CN Tower — Worth It?

I started with the obvious. The CN Tower is iconic, and the views don’t disappoint. Standing on the glass floor isn’t for everyone (felt that vertigo), but you get a serious perspective on how big the city really is. Get there early or book ahead—queues stack up fast.

## Raptors & Blue Jays — Local Sports Culture

**Scotiabank Arena (NBA):**  
I caught a Raptors game, and the energy inside is intense. Every possession gets a reaction. Drake wasn’t courtside, but you can feel his influence—this is definitely his city.

**Rogers Centre (MLB):**  
Also made time for a Blue Jays game. The open roof and skyline views make it one of the better ballpark setups I’ve seen. Family friendly, good atmosphere, easy to access.

## Ripley’s Aquarium

A solid option when the weather turns. The layout is immersive, and the jellyfish tunnel and shark lagoon are standout sections. It’s not just for kids—if you’re into nature or photography, it’s worth the visit.

Buy aquarium tickets online to skip queues—especially on weekends or rainy days.

## Local Food — What to Try

Toronto’s food scene reflects its diversity. Here's what stood out:

- **Tim Hortons:** Coffee and Timbits live up to the hype.
- **Poutine:** Rich, simple, and satisfying. Gravy + cheese curds + fries = yes.
- **Maple Everything:** Candy, syrup, snacks—you’ll see it everywhere.
- **IHOP:** Tried pancakes for comparison. Decent, but I prefer homemade.

## Niagara Falls — Day Trip Must

It’s a two-hour drive from downtown, but 100% worth it.

- **Hornblower boat ride:** Right at the base of the falls. Soaked, but unforgettable. Bring a dry bag.
- **Observation areas:** Plenty of walkways for dry views and panoramas.
