# Lisbon — Food, Elevation, and Atmosphere

Lisbon offers a solid mix of culture, architecture, and food, with an edge of effort thanks to its endless hills and staircases. Here’s what stood out from my time in the city — and what I’d recommend if you’re planning your own visit.

## 🏰 Alfama & the Historic Core

Alfama is where Lisbon still feels like a village. Narrow cobbled lanes, laundry flapping overhead, and the echo of Fado music through the windows.

- **São Jorge Castle:** Worth the climb. Panoramic views across the red rooftops and the Tagus River — one of the best vantage points in the city.
- **Tram 28:** Yes, it’s crowded and touristy, but it winds through some of the most iconic parts of the city. Take it early in the day to avoid queues.
- **Tilework:** All over the city. Buildings covered in azulejos (ceramic tiles) give Lisbon a distinctive visual character.

## 🌉 Waterfront & Market Life

- **Ponte 25 de Abril:** Structurally similar to the Golden Gate Bridge, it anchors the skyline. You can’t walk it, but you’ll spot it constantly.
- **Time Out Market:** A good intro to Lisbon’s food scene in one place. It’s busy and commercial, but still worth a visit. Grab a drink, try a few local dishes, and take your time.

## 🍽️ Food Notes

- **Pastel de nata:** A local obsession. Best had warm, with a dusting of cinnamon. I tried a lot — the ones from _Manteigaria_ stood out.
- **Seafood:** No shortage of options — grilled sardines, octopus rice, and bacalhau (cod) prepared a dozen ways.
- **Ginjinha:** A sour cherry liqueur served in a shot glass, often with fruit at the bottom. Worth trying once.

## ✅ Practical Tips

- **Footwear matters:** You’ll be climbing hills and stairs daily — wear shoes with grip.
- **Pickpockets:** Stay aware, especially in crowded areas like the tram or tourist hotspots.
- **Miradouros (viewpoints):** Lisbon has several — _Miradouro de Santa Catarina_ is especially good for golden hour views across the river.

Lisbon has range — from historic charm to busy markets and waterfront views. If you enjoy walking, eating well, and uncovering smaller corners of a city, you’ll probably enjoy it here. The pace is manageable, the food is memorable, and the city’s light is one of a kind.
