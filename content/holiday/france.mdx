# Paris Travel Notes: A City That Delivers

Paris lives up to its reputation—grand, busy, and impossible to see in just one trip. I hit all the major sights, soaked up the street culture, and even made it to Roland-Garros for world-class tennis. Here’s what stood out, no sugar-coating.

Paris is dense and never slow. The city’s architecture and skyline are iconic for a reason—every turn is another postcard. Locals keep to themselves, but the pace is high and the energy is real.

## Landmarks — Yes, They're Worth It

- **Eiffel Tower:** Touristy, but still impressive up close. Get there early or late to avoid the worst crowds. The nighttime light show is genuinely cool.
- **Louvre Museum:** The art is world-class and the building itself is a highlight. Expect crowds for Mona Lisa but plenty of quieter galleries if you wander.
- **Notre-Dame:** Even with ongoing restoration, it’s worth a walk-by. The area around it (Île de la Cité) is packed with history.
- **Montmartre & Sacré-Cœur:** Best city views from the steps and the surrounding neighborhood feels like classic Paris—cafés, artists, and winding streets.

## Roland-Garros — Tennis at Its Best

A major highlight was visiting Roland-Garros for the French Open. The energy during a Grand Slam is unreal—packed stands, tight matches, and the clay adds a unique challenge you don’t see anywhere else. If you’re a tennis fan, this is bucket-list stuff. Tickets aren’t cheap but worth every euro for the atmosphere alone.

## Food — Classics and Surprises

- **Baguette sandwiches & pastries:** Bakeries (boulangeries) are everywhere. Grab a fresh baguette or croissant in the morning and you’ll understand the hype.
- **French bistro meals:** Tried steak frites, onion soup, and various cheese boards. Generally rich, but portions are smaller than in the UK or US.
- **Café culture:** Sitting outside with an espresso is a cliché, but a good one. Service can be slow—don’t expect to be rushed.

## Getting Around

- **Metro:** Fast, mostly reliable, and gets you almost anywhere. Can get crowded at rush hour. Buy a carnet of tickets for convenience.
- **Walking:** Paris is best seen on foot. Some days I hit 20,000+ steps without even trying.
- **Scooters:** If you’re feeling adventurous, e-scooters are everywhere and make short trips fun (if a bit chaotic).

## Other Sights & Quick Tips

- **Seine River:** Walking along or taking a boat tour is a great way to see the city from a different angle.
- **Champs-Élysées & Arc de Triomphe:** Worth a visit for the views and people-watching, but skip the overpriced shops.
- **Museums:** Besides the Louvre, Musée d’Orsay and Centre Pompidou are both excellent.
- **Safety:** Pickpockets are a thing around busy attractions—keep your valuables close.
- **Weather:** I went in June—warm but not scorching. Sudden rain is common, so pack a small umbrella.

## Final Thoughts

Paris is touristy, crowded, sometimes pricey, and still 100% worth it. From landmark-hopping to world-class tennis at Roland-Garros, bakery breakfasts to long walks along the Seine, it’s a city that keeps giving. Plan for crowds, pace yourself, and you’ll get the best out of it.
