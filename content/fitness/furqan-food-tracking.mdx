## MyFitnessPal: The Starting Point

### **Why I Started With It**
Back when I first decided to get serious about nutrition, **MyFitnessPal (MFP)** was the obvious choice. It was free, popular, and had a huge food database.

I used it to:
- Log everything I ate manually (tedious but helpful)
- Understand calorie and macro breakdowns
- Spot portion size mistakes (spoiler: I was underestimating by a lot)

### **What Worked**
- Barcode scanning was quick  
- Huge database (especially helpful in the UK)  
- Helped me grasp portion sizes and macro content

### **The Frustrations**
- Tons of inaccurate entries in the public database  
- Pop-ups, ads, and a slow UI  
- Needed workarounds to do things like track weight trends or fiber  
- Paid version started walling off features like macro targets per meal

Eventually, tracking became something I *wanted* to do faster and more accurately. That’s where MacroFactor came in.

## Why I Switched to MacroFactor

After reading a ton of praise from evidence-based fitness folks, I gave **MacroFactor** a shot—and didn’t look back. It’s built for people who want **data accuracy, flexible dieting, and less obsession**.

### **What Makes It Better**
- **Verified food database** (not crowd-sourced junk)  
- **Auto-adjusting macros** based on progress  
- **Weight trend tracking** with smart smoothing  
- **No pressure to hit exact macros every day**  
- **No ads or pop-ups**

It’s not free, but it’s absolutely worth it for the features you get.

## My Current Workflow

### **How I Log Food**
- Log throughout the day, not just at night (more accurate)  
- Pre-log meals if I know what’s coming  
- Weigh major ingredients, but I estimate condiments/sauces  
- Use the same foods often to speed things up (meal templates help)

### **Weight Tracking**
- Weigh myself daily (naked, fasted, same time)  
- Let MacroFactor calculate my **weight trend**, not just raw number  
- This gives me a better signal of whether I’m gaining/losing/maintaining

### **Macro Strategy**
- I track **calories + protein**, not every macro to the gram  
- Eat the same breakfast/lunch most days, flexible dinner  
- Hit **fiber**, stay hydrated, and allow treats in moderation

### **Check-Ins**
- Once a week, I glance at my weight trend, average calories, and macro consistency  
- If I’m maintaining, I stay the course  
- If I want to cut or bulk, I let the app nudge the targets

## Lessons I’ve Learned

- **You don’t have to be perfect to make progress**  
- **Accuracy matters more than effort**—get good data with less work  
- **Weight trends are more important than daily scale swings**  
- **No food is off limits** if you understand portion size and plan ahead  
- **Habits > willpower**—I eat similarly on weekdays, leave room on weekends

## Final Thoughts

I still recommend **MyFitnessPal** for beginners just getting started—it’s accessible and teaches the basics. But if you’re serious about performance, consistency, or body composition goals, **MacroFactor is the better tool**.

It’s helped me stop second-guessing myself and focus on what matters: **eating well, staying consistent, and not obsessing over every gram.**
