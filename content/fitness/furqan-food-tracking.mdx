> **Tracking your food isn’t rocket science—but doing it well is a game changer.** Here’s how I figured out calorie and macro tracking without losing my mind, the apps I tried (spoiler: MacroFactor wins), and my simple workflow that keeps results coming.

## Why I Started with MyFitnessPal

**Back in the day**, MyFitnessPal (MFP) was basically *the* tool everyone used to get a handle on nutrition. Huge database, easy barcode scanning, and totally free (for a while).

- **What worked:**  
  - Simple barcode scan  
  - Massive UK food database  
  - Taught me real portion sizes (turns out I was always underestimating, oops)

- **What annoyed me:**  
  - Lots of bad/inaccurate crowd entries  
  - Endless ads, pop-ups, slow UI  
  - More and more features locked behind paywalls (even per-meal macros!)
  - No built-in trend tracking or good weight insights

Eventually, I wanted something less clunky, more accurate, and (let’s be honest) less ad-infested. Enter MacroFactor.

## Why I Switched to MacroFactor

After seeing it recommended by evidence-based fitness nerds, I gave **MacroFactor** a try—and it actually made me enjoy food tracking again.

**What makes it different:**  
- **Verified food database** (no more crowd-sourced chaos)  
- **Auto-adjusts macros** based on actual progress  
- **Built-in weight trend tracking** (not just raw scale numbers)  
- **No pressure to be perfect every day**  
- **Zero ads, popups, or dark patterns**  
- Not free, but 100% worth it for what you get

## My Current Tracking Workflow

**How I log food:**  
- Log throughout the day (not just at night)  
- Pre-log meals if I know my plan  
- Weigh big stuff, estimate sauces/condiments  
- Use frequent foods & meal templates for speed

**How I track weight:**  
- Daily weigh-ins (naked, fasted, same time)  
- MacroFactor’s **weight trend** is what I actually care about

**My macro strategy:**  
- I focus on **calories + protein**—don’t sweat carbs/fats to the gram  
- I eat almost the same breakfast/lunch, dinner is more flexible  
- Fiber, water, treats in moderation = all still in

**My check-ins:**  
- Weekly: quick review of weight trend, average cals, and consistency  
- If I’m maintaining, cool. If cutting/bulking, tweak targets as needed.

## What I’ve Learned

- **Consistency wins, not perfection**  
- **Data beats effort**—get it right, don’t just work harder  
- **Weight trend > daily fluctuations**  
- **All foods can fit** if you plan ahead and control portions  
- **Habits > willpower**—my weekdays are autopilot, weekends are flexible

## Final Thoughts

I still recommend **MyFitnessPal** for total beginners—it’s accessible and teaches nutrition basics. But if you’re really chasing results, hate ads, or want smarter feedback, **MacroFactor** is where it’s at.

It lets me focus on living and eating, not obsessing over every gram.
