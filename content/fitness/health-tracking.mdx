**You can’t improve what you don’t measure.**  
Here’s my approach to tracking key health stats (weight, sleep, blood pressure, and more) with smart tech—so I know what’s really going on between checkups.

## Why I Track My Health (Even With NHS & Private Healthcare)

The NHS is *excellent* for emergencies and chronic issues. My private plan is great for fast access if something goes wrong.  
**But I’d rather not wait for something to break** before I notice a problem.

- **Early warnings:** Devices flag high blood pressure, rising weight, or poor sleep before they’re “an issue”  
- **Spotting trends:** One doctor visit = a snapshot; tracking at home = the full movie  
- **Real accountability:** When my steps, sleep, or weight trend slip, I see it—and can do something now, not six months later

## My Health Tracking Tech Stack

### 🟦 Withings Body Scan

**Daily:** Quick weigh-in and full body composition check.

- **Tracks:**  
  - Weight  
  - Body fat %  
  - Visceral fat  
  - Muscle mass  
  - Hydration  
  - Segmental fat/muscle (arms, legs, torso)

- **Why I rate it:**  
  Super consistent, data syncs instantly, and the app makes historical trends easy. I see progress (or warning signs) way before a random GP weigh-in ever could.

### 🟦 Withings BPM Core

**Weekly:** Blood pressure and heart health check-in.

- **Tracks:**  
  - Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)  
  - Heart rate  
  - ECG (basic, but useful)

- **Why it matters:**  
  High blood pressure runs in my family. I’d rather catch it early than deal with the consequences. I bring the app’s data to my GP—no more “white coat syndrome.”

### 🟦 Withings Bemo

**Daily:** Recovery, sleep, and daily health pulse.

- **Tracks:**  
  - Heart rate  
  - Breathing rate  
  - Sleep quality  
  - Body temperature

- **Why I care:**  
  How I sleep, how I recover from workouts, and how stress is affecting me—all in one place. It’s more than “just steps,” it’s about how ready my body is for life.

### 🍏 Apple Watch Ultra 2

**All day:** Activity, steps, and on-wrist health stats.

- **Tracks:**  
  - Steps, movement, calories  
  - HR (resting, workout, sleep)  
  - ECG, blood oxygen  
  - Workout stats (runs, HIIT, swims—you name it)

- **Why I love it:**  
  The step count keeps me honest. Apple Health aggregates *everything*—so I see my big health picture, not random data points.

## My Simple Health Tracking Workflow

- **Morning:** Quick weigh-in with Withings Body Scan  
- **Weekly:** Blood pressure check with BPM Core (more often if needed)  
- **Night:** Sleep data and recovery stats auto-sync from Bemo and Apple Watch  
- **Throughout the day:** Apple Watch tracks movement, exercise, and on-demand HR  
- **Monthly:** Review all trends in the Withings and Apple Health apps—adjust habits if anything’s creeping in the wrong direction

## Why This Works for Me

- **Takes 2 minutes a day** (not an exaggeration)  
- **No more guessing** about my health status between doctor visits  
- **Easier to catch issues early**, tweak habits, and feel in control  
- **Data = peace of mind**—no surprises at the next checkup

## Don’t Need Every Device? Here’s What to Track

Even just one device (like a smart scale or watch) can make a huge difference.

**If you only pick one:**  
- For weight/body comp: A smart scale  
- For movement/activity: Any fitness tracker or watch  
- For heart health: An occasional BP check (ask your pharmacy!)

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need to become a health data geek—but a *bit* of tracking can bridge the gap between your daily life and the doctor’s office.  
It keeps you proactive, not reactive.

**Your health is your responsibility—track what matters, then act on what you find.**
