## Why INSANITY?

I’ll be honest: Most “cardio” bored me to tears. I’d jog, zone out, barely sweat, and feel like I wasted 30 minutes. That changed when I discovered **INSANITY**—the original at-home HIIT program from Shaun T that went viral for a reason.

It’s not about fancy gym machines or endless running. It’s about pushing your limits with *max* interval training: long bursts of all-out effort with short recovery periods, using nothing but bodyweight. Every session leaves you drenched, breathing hard, and somehow proud of yourself for surviving.

## How I Run It (Literally and Figuratively)

I bring INSANITY to my gym (and sometimes my living room if the weather sucks). Here’s how I make it part of my weekly cardio routine:

### **Weekly Structure**

- 2–3 INSANITY sessions per week (never two days in a row—trust me)
- Rotate between main workouts: *Plyometric Cardio Circuit, Max Interval Plyo, Pure Cardio*, and *Cardio Power & Resistance*
- Some days I use the “Fit Test” as a quick challenge or warm-up
- Always warm up for 5 minutes (Shaun T’s “warm up” is harder than most people’s workout)
- Finish with the INSANITY stretch (seriously, don’t skip it—prevents injury and you’ll need it)

### **Sample Workout Breakdown**

**Plyometric Cardio Circuit:**  
Alternating between explosive squat jumps, push-ups, and agility drills that leave my heart rate spiking.

**Pure Cardio:**  
No breaks—just one continuous circuit of non-stop bodyweight moves. By the end, I’m gasping and covered in sweat. (If you don’t need a break after this one, you’re a robot.)

**Max Interval Plyo:**  
Extended intervals, lots of jumping, lots of pain. Fantastic for building lower body power and endurance.

**Cardio Power & Resistance:**  
Mix of classic HIIT and some surprisingly tough bodyweight strength (push-ups, tricep dips, etc.)

## Why I Always Use a Heart Rate Monitor

I used to just guess if I was “working hard enough.” Not anymore. I now wear a heart rate monitor (usually a chest strap, sometimes a smart watch) every session.

- **Keeps me honest:** Can’t cheat when you see your actual HR on screen
- **Zone training:** I know when I’m in the right intensity zone for fat burn, HIIT, or max effort
- **Motivation:** Watching my recovery improve over time = real progress
- **Safety:** I know when I’m overreaching and need a longer rest (or to dial it back)

For the record, **my HR regularly hits 90–95% of max** during the “main sets,” which is insane (pun intended) but super effective. Recovery between rounds is a stat I actually track—less time to get back to baseline = better cardio fitness.

## What INSANITY Has Done for Me

- **Conditioning:** Legit next-level. Sports, lifting, even walking upstairs got easier.
- **Calorie burn:** Some workouts hit 500–700 kcal (tracked on my HRM, not an app guess)
- **Mental toughness:** There’s nothing like pushing through a round when your body says “nah.”
- **No boredom:** Moves are always changing. You never plateau.
- **Agility & explosiveness:** My jumps, sprints, and even coordination got noticeably better.

---

## Downsides & Real Talk

- **It’s tough.** No way around it. If you’re new, pace yourself. Take extra breaks, drink water, and don’t expect to match Shaun T on day one.
- **Not every gym has space for all the jumping around, so I sometimes do it at home or in an empty studio.**
- **Rest days are not optional.** Seriously, your joints and nervous system need recovery. I usually do these on non-lifting days.

## Would I Recommend It?

If you want to push your cardio to another level (and don’t mind sweating buckets), INSANITY is legit.  
For me, the biggest level-up was tracking my HR—seeing real data, knowing I’m progressing, and not leaving results to chance.  
If you like challenges, variety, and want to actually feel your heart and lungs working, this is for you.

**TL;DR:**  
Most cardio routines are mid. INSANITY isn’t. Add a heart rate monitor and it’s gamified suffering that pays off.  
Let me know if you have Qs or want to swap routines!
