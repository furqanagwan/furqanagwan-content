> **You can’t improve what you don’t measure.** I use a handful of smart devices to keep tabs on my health—so I’m never guessing about my progress or waiting for a doctor’s appointment to spot a problem.

## What I Use—and Why

### **Withings Body Scan**
This is my go-to for daily weigh-ins and body composition checks.
- **What it measures:**
  - Weight
  - Body fat %
  - Visceral fat
  - Muscle mass
  - Hydration
  - Segmental analysis (fat & muscle in arms, legs, torso)
- **Why I use it:**
  It’s fast, super consistent, and syncs data straight to my phone. Historical trends are clearer than anything I’d get from an occasional GP weigh-in.

### **Withings BPM Core**
Blood pressure is easy to ignore—until it’s not. I use the BPM Core to check mine weekly.
- **What it measures:**
  - Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic)
  - Heart rate
  - Can even record a basic ECG
- **Why I use it:**
  Silent high blood pressure runs in my family. Early tracking = early intervention. I share results with my GP during checkups.

### **Withings Bemo**
This one covers my daily vitals and overall well-being.
- **What it tracks:**
  - Heart rate
  - Breathing
  - Sleep quality
  - Body temperature
- **Why I use it:**
  It gives me a snapshot of recovery and how stress/sleep affects my body—not just my workouts.

### **Apple Watch Ultra 2**
For steps, activity, and on-wrist health data.
- **What it tracks:**
  - Daily steps & movement
  - Heart rate (during workouts & sleep)
  - ECG, blood oxygen
  - Workout stats (runs, walks, swimming)
- **Why I use it:**
  Nothing keeps me honest about movement like a step count staring back at me. Apple Health pulls it all together so I see the big picture.

## Why Track if I Have NHS & Private Healthcare?

The NHS is world-class for emergencies and long-term conditions. My job covers private healthcare for fast specialist access. But **I don’t want to wait until something’s broken to know how I’m doing**.
- Devices give me early warnings—high blood pressure, weight creep, low sleep quality—so I can adjust habits or see a doctor sooner.
- Trends are what matter: I spot patterns in weight, blood pressure, or sleep that a single doctor’s visit would miss.
- Real-time tracking = real accountability. If I see my steps or weight trend drop, I know to move more or check my eating.

## Final Thoughts

You don’t need to obsess or buy every device. But if you want to take charge of your health, a few smart trackers can make a huge difference.
For me, they bridge the gap between the doctor’s office and daily life—**so I always know where I stand, and I never leave my health to chance.**
