Tracking your food isn’t rocket science—but doing it well is a game changer. Here’s how I figured out calorie and macro tracking without losing my mind, the apps I tried (spoiler: MacroFactor wins), and the simple workflow that keeps results coming.

## Why I Started with MyFitnessPal

**Back in the day**, MyFitnessPal (MFP) was basically *the* tool everyone used to get a handle on nutrition. Huge database, easy barcode scanning, and totally free (for a while).

**What worked:**

- Simple barcode scanning  
- Massive UK food database  
- Taught me real portion sizes (turns out I was always underestimating—oops)

**What annoyed me:**

- Tons of inaccurate crowd-sourced entries  
- Endless ads, pop-ups, and laggy UI  
- More and more features locked behind paywalls (even per-meal macros!)  
- No proper trend tracking or useful weight insights

Eventually, I wanted something less clunky, more accurate, and (let’s be real) less ad-infested.

## Why I Switched to MacroFactor

After seeing it recommended by evidence-based fitness nerds, I gave **MacroFactor** a try—and honestly, it made me enjoy food tracking again.

**What makes it different:**

- **Verified food database** (no more random crowd chaos)  
- **Auto-adjusts macros** based on actual progress  
- **Built-in weight trend tracking** (not just raw scale numbers)  
- **No pressure to be perfect every day**  
- **Zero ads, popups, or shady UX tricks**  
- Not free—but 100% worth it for what you get

## My Current Tracking Workflow

### How I log food:
- Log throughout the day (not just at night)  
- Pre-log meals if I know my plan  
- Weigh big items, estimate sauces/condiments  
- Use frequent foods and meal templates to speed things up

### How I track weight:
- Daily weigh-ins (naked, fasted, same time)  
- MacroFactor’s **weight trend** is what I actually care about

### My macro strategy:
- Focus on **calories + protein**—don’t stress carbs/fats to the gram  
- Mostly consistent breakfast/lunch, more flexible dinner  
- Fiber, hydration, and treats all factored in

### My check-ins:
- Weekly review: weight trend, average calories, and consistency  
- If I’m maintaining—cool. If I’m cutting/bulking—tweak and move on.

## What I’ve Learned

- **Consistency > perfection**  
- **Data > effort**—don’t just grind, get smarter  
- **Weight trends > daily fluctuations**  
- **All foods can fit** if you plan and portion  
- **Habits > willpower**—my weekdays run on autopilot, weekends are flexible

## Final Thoughts

I still recommend **MyFitnessPal** for beginners—it’s free, familiar, and good for learning the basics. But if you’re serious about results, hate ads, or want smarter feedback, **MacroFactor** is where it’s at.

It helps me focus on living and eating—not obsessing over every gram.
