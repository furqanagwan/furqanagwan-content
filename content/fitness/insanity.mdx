## The Cardio Problem: Why I Ditched “Traditional” Workouts

If you’re like me, endless treadmill or bike sessions just don’t hit. I’d zone out, barely sweat, and feel…meh.  
That changed when I found **INSANITY Max:30**—Shaun T’s follow-up to his original HIIT series that pushes you to your absolute limits in just 30 minutes.

**Why it works:**  
- **Max Interval Training** = long bursts of full-out effort, short recovery, all bodyweight.  
- Every session is different. It’s brutal, sweaty, and somehow addictive.  
- No gym? No problem. I run these in my living room or gym studio.

## My Weekly INSANITY Max:30 Routine (and How I Actually Use It)

I don’t just follow the calendar—I make it fit my life and my other training.

### **What my week looks like:**
- 3–4 **INSANITY Max:30** sessions per week (never back-to-back—trust me, you need rest)
- Rotate: *Cardio Challenge*, *Tabata Strength*, *Sweat Intervals*, *Friday Fight*
- Occasionally: *Pulse* for active recovery
- Always:  
  - **Warm up** (which feels like a full workout)  
  - **Stretch after**—or your legs will fight you the next day

### **What the Workouts Are Like**

**Cardio Challenge:**  
Your baseline workout—and it still slaps. Pure endurance test, minimal rest.

**Sweat Intervals:**  
Cardio mixed with strength, and a whole lot of dripping sweat.

**Tabata Strength:**  
Bodyweight-focused muscle burnout with 20s on/10s off intervals.

**Friday Fight (Round 1/2):**  
Max-out central. You vs. your brain. It’s chaos—in a good way.

**Pulse:**  
Low-intensity recovery with lots of isometric holds. Feels easy until it doesn’t.

## Why I Always Track My Heart Rate

I used to “guess” my effort. Not anymore.  
With a heart rate monitor (chest strap or smartwatch), I get:

- **Real feedback:** No cheating. You’re either in the zone, or you aren’t.
- **Target zones:** I know exactly when I’m hitting HIIT/fat burn/max effort.
- **Motivation:** Recovery time gets faster = progress I can *see*.
- **Safety:** If my HR is through the roof, I take a breather—no shame.

**FYI:**  
- My heart rate often hits 90–95% of max in main sets.  
- Recovery between rounds is my favorite “hidden metric”—improves as fitness goes up.

## What Changed for Me (Beyond Just “Getting Fitter”)

- **Conditioning:** Sports, lifting, stairs—all easier.  
- **Calorie burn:** 400–600 kcal in a single session (based on real HRM data).  
- **Mental toughness:** You learn to push past “I want to quit.”  
- **No boredom:** Variety every session. Plateau? What’s that?  
- **Agility & explosiveness:** Jumps, sprints, and coordination = all up.

---

## Downsides? Here’s the Real Talk

- **It’s hard.** If you’re new, pace yourself. Breaks are normal.
- **Space can be an issue.** Not every gym is “jumping jack” friendly, so sometimes it’s at home.
- **Rest days matter.** You need recovery—especially if you lift on other days.

## Would I Recommend INSANITY Max:30?

If you’re bored with cardio, want a challenge, and like seeing real progress on your fitness tracker, this is for you.

- **Try it for a month.** Track your HR, and watch how fast you improve.
- If you want variety, challenge, and don’t mind working, it’s legit.

## TL;DR

Most cardio routines are mid. **INSANITY Max:30** isn’t.  
Add a heart rate monitor and it’s gamified suffering that gets results.
