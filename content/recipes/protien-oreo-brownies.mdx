## Ingredients

- **120g** Grenade Hydra 6 Whey Chocolate
  _Substitute:_ Any chocolate or cookies & cream whey (use one with good baking results)
- **160g** Tesco 0% Fat Greek Yogurt
  _Substitute:_ Skyr, Fage Total 0%, or any thick plain yogurt
- **2** Tesco Medium Free Range Eggs (**104g out of shell**)
  _Substitute:_ Flax eggs (vegan, but texture will change)
- **24g** Dr. Oetker Cocoa Powder (about 6 tsp)
  _Substitute:_ Any unsweetened cocoa powder
- **60g** Billingtons Golden Caster Sugar
  _Substitute:_ Sweetener blend (adjust to taste)
- **40g** McDougalls Plain Flour
  _Substitute:_ Oat flour (for gluten-free)
- **8** Oreo Original Sandwich Cookies (approx. 92g, divided)
  _Substitute:_ Gluten-free or protein cookie alternatives if needed
- **1 tsp (5g)** Dr. Oetker Baking Powder
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 180°C (160°C fan). Line a small baking tin (20×20cm) with parchment.
2. **Mix wet:** In a large bowl, whisk together Greek yogurt, eggs, and sugar until smooth.
3. **Combine dry:** In another bowl, mix protein powder, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.
4. **Fold:** Add the dry ingredients into the wet, stirring until just combined. Don’t over-mix.
5. **Crush & add Oreos:** Reserve 2 Oreos for topping. Roughly crush the remaining 6 and fold into the batter.
6. **Bake:** Pour batter into tin, smooth the top, and break the last 2 Oreos over the surface for a chunky top.
7. Bake for **14–18 minutes**—edges set, center just a little underbaked for fudgy brownies.
8. Cool in tin for 10 minutes, then lift out and cut into 8 squares.

## Serving Ideas

- Serve with extra Greek yogurt or protein ice cream for more protein.
- Drizzle with melted dark chocolate for an indulgent finish.
- Keeps in the fridge for 3–4 days—microwave for 10 seconds for that fresh-baked texture.

### Portioning Tip

Each brownie should weigh about **43g (raw batter)** before baking for accurate nutrition and batch size.
Once baked, expect each brownie to be around **38g** (moist, dense texture).
For best accuracy, weigh your finished bake and divide by 8.
