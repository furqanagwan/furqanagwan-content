## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 175°C (155°C fan). Line a baking tray with parchment paper.
2. **Mix wet:** In a large bowl, stir together peanut butter, Greek yogurt, sugar, egg, and vanilla until smooth.
3. **Add dry:** Fold in oats, protein powder, flour, baking powder, salt, and any optional extras.

### Portioning Tip

Each cookie should weigh about **68g (raw dough)** before baking for accurate nutrition and batch size.  
After baking, each cookie will typically weigh around **60g** due to moisture loss in the oven.  
Use a kitchen scale for best results.
