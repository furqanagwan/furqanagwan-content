3. **Combine:** Stir wet ingredients into dry until just combined (don’t overmix).
4. **Cook:** Heat a lightly greased non-stick pan over medium. Pour ~1/4 cup (about 55g) of batter per pancake. Cook 2–3 min until bubbles form, then flip and cook another 1–2 min until golden.
5. **Serve:** Makes about 4–5 pancakes total. One serving is half the batch.
