_Speed 2: Cruise Control_ trades the breakneck tension of its predecessor for a slow, waterlogged disaster.

---

## What Stands Out

**Direction & Cinematography**

The ocean liner setting is ambitious, but the action is clumsy and lacks urgency.

**Performances & Casting**

Sandra Bullock is game, but Jason Patric is no Keanu. Willem Dafoe is wasted as a cartoonish villain.

**Score & Sound Design**

Score is forgettable; sound design is decent but unremarkable.

**Visual Effects & Production Design**

The cruise ship stunts are big but feel fake. CGI has not aged well.

## Areas for Improvement

**Pacing & Editing**

Glacial pace. Way too long, and the tension is missing.

**Story & Script**

Plot is laughable. The dialogue is awkward and repetitive.

**Character Development**

None. You root for Sandra Bullock just because she’s Sandra Bullock.

**Themes & Message**

Tries for romance and danger but delivers neither.

## Key Themes Explored

- **Disaster:** But not in the good way.
- **Romance:** But you don’t buy it.
- **Technology Gone Wrong:** But it’s contrived.

## Final Verdict

_Skip this cruise. A lesson in how not to do an action sequel._

**My Score:** ★½☆☆☆ out of 5
