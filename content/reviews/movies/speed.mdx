_Speed_ is the ultimate “high-concept” action movie—a bomb on a bus, non-stop tension, and two of the decade’s biggest stars at their peak.

## What Stands Out

**Direction & Cinematography**

Jan de Bont keeps the pace electric, with handheld shots and inventive camera work that pulls you into the chaos.

**Performances & Casting**

Keanu Reeves is the perfect everyman action hero. Sandra Bullock is endlessly likable, and Dennis Hopper is gloriously over-the-top as the villain.

**Score & Sound Design**

Mark Mancina’s score is pulse-pounding, and the sound design cranks up the anxiety.

**Visual Effects & Production Design**

The bus stunts remain jaw-dropping. Minimal CGI keeps everything grounded and visceral.

## Areas for Improvement

**Pacing & Editing**

The finale slows a bit after the main bus plot, but overall the editing is taut.

**Story & Script**

The script is lean and smart, though the dialogue is sometimes cheesy.

**Character Development**

Basic, but effective for an action flick. The chemistry between Reeves and Bullock sells it.

**Themes & Message**

Mostly about survival and heroism under pressure—simple but effective.

## Key Themes Explored

- **Survival:** The tension never lets up.
- **Heroism:** Ordinary people in extraordinary situations.
- **Trust:** Key to keeping the passengers alive.

## Final Verdict

_One of the most purely entertaining thrillers of the 90s—a must-watch for action fans._

**My Score:** ★★★★☆½ out of 5
