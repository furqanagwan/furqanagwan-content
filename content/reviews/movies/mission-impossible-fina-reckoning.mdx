author: Furqan Agwan
summary: A flat, overlong conclusion to Ethan Hunt’s latest mission—technically slick but creatively drained. Earlier entries had urgency, stakes, and soul. This doesn’t.

_Dead Reckoning Part Two_ should have been a crescendo—the payoff to one of modern action’s most consistent franchises. Instead, it’s a tired, overly serious slog that mistakes bloat for scale. There are good stunts, yes—but by now that’s expected. What’s missing is spark. The tension. The clarity. The momentum. The soul.

## What Stands Out

**Stunt Execution**  
Cruise continues to defy gravity and reason. There’s an underwater sequence that’s impressively filmed and a brutal rooftop fight with smart choreography. From a logistics standpoint, this is high-level moviemaking.

**Location Work & Cinematography**  
The globe-trotting visuals are polished—desert ruins, icy landscapes, and neon-soaked cities give the film texture. The camera work is controlled and confident, even when the story isn’t.

**Lorne Balfe’s Score**  
Balfe’s themes build atmosphere and energy when the script can’t. The score works overtime to inject suspense and grandeur.

## Where It Falls Apart

**Exhausting Runtime**  
At nearly three hours, the film drags. Long stretches of setup lead nowhere. Dialogue scenes over-explain vague stakes. The pacing limps instead of sprints—and it takes a toll.

**Convoluted Plot, No Payoff**  
After all the buildup from Part One, the AI threat (“The Entity”) still feels intangible. There’s no strong villain, no strong ideology, no personal hook. Just characters chasing a MacGuffin we’re told is dangerous but rarely shown why.

**Ethan Hunt on Autopilot**  
Cruise still commits physically, but his character feels hollow. Hunt used to walk a line between duty and emotional cost. Here, he’s a plot function—never vulnerable, never pushed. There's no real arc, just repetition.

**Supporting Cast Wasted**  
Rebecca Ferguson’s absence is noticeable. Hayley Atwell, introduced in Part One, is sidelined. Ving Rhames and Simon Pegg are barely involved in any meaningful way. Everyone’s here, but no one has purpose.

**Over-Serious Tone**  
The film takes itself far too seriously. There’s no levity, no warmth, no camaraderie. It’s a cold, mechanical film trying to feel important, but not giving us much reason to care.

## Themes & Attempts

**AI Paranoia**  
The core theme—losing control to digital systems—is timely but poorly explored. It’s all surface-level: whispered warnings, screen graphics, and exposition. There’s no human face to the threat, no memorable confrontation. It’s abstract conflict with no emotional consequence.

**The Weight of Legacy**  
The film flirts with big questions: how long can Ethan Hunt keep doing this? At what cost? But it never commits. These ideas are hinted at and dropped just as quickly.

## What Could Be Better

- Overwritten, underdeveloped script
- Vague and repetitive plotting
- Underused cast and weak character arcs
- Emotionally distant tone
- No satisfying payoff after Part One’s setup

## Final Thoughts

_Dead Reckoning Part Two_ feels like a mission that forgot its objective. There’s still talent behind the camera and commitment in the performances, but the soul of the series is missing. Compared to _Fallout_ or _Rogue Nation_, this feels like fan service without stakes—too serious to be fun, too convoluted to be tense. The series deserved a better send-off.

**My score:** ★★☆☆☆ out of 5
