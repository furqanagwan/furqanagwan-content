MindsEye looked like it might be the next big thing—“a GTA-style open-world shooter with creative tools.” But what it delivers is a glitch-ridden, unpolished mess that’s absolutely **not worth full price** yet.

## 🎮 What Went Wrong

**Disappointing Launch**  
At launch, players on Xbox faced stutters, crashes, blurry cutscenes, and 30 FPS frame drops—even on Series X. Most reviews landed around 3 / 5 from users, soaked in complaints about low performance.

**Buggy Foundations**  
MindsEye feels like a bargain-bin hit from the 2010s: floating NPCs, cars exploding mid-air, and cover systems that barely stick. Frequent glitches make it hard to enjoy the few good bits.

**Shallow Gameplay Loop**  
Missions largely boil down to “drive somewhere → shoot dudes → watch cheesy cutscene → repeat.” Lacks variety, depth, or creative hooks—just expensive repetition told with ambition but executed mediocrely.

**Underwhelming Design**  
Despite some slick visuals and satirical world-building, the AI is dumb, the story is thin, and driving/shooting feel stale. A “feast for the eyes, headache for the mind” rings true.

## ⚠️ Mixed Spots

- There are some impressive cutscenes, albeit overshadowed by when the game breaks.
- Player reviews note it *can* be enjoyable when patches land—and there’s potential in the creation tools—though nothing justifies the $60 tag yet.

## ❌ Should You Buy or Bail?

Nope—you’re better off **waiting for a discount or patches**.  
At current price, it feels half-baked. Even enthusiastic fans suggest waiting at least one major patch.

## 🔧 Final Verdict

MindsEye aims high with dystopian themes and user creation tools—but it lands flat. Rushed, repetitive, and glitchy, it’s a mediocre shell of its hype. Recommended price: **under $20**, definitely *not worth full price*.

**Final Score:** ★★☆☆☆ (2 / 5)
