# Netherlands Travel Notes: Amsterdam, Rotterdam & Mirchi Fest

A couple of days in the Netherlands sounds short, but you can fit in a lot: canal cruises, world-class coffee, bikes everywhere, a Desi music festival, and some underrated eats. Here’s what I packed in, what stood out, and tips if you’re planning a similar trip.

:::note First Impressions
The Netherlands is shockingly efficient. Public transport runs to the second, streets are spotless, and there are more bikes than people. English is everywhere and locals are relaxed—except when dodging bikes!

## Mirchi Fest — Amsterdam’s Desi Music Experience

If you’re into Indian/Desi music, **Mirchi Fest** is wild. Hosted right in Amsterdam, it pulls a huge South Asian crowd and the vibes are closer to Mumbai or Delhi than Europe.
**What to expect:**
- Live performances: From Bollywood to Punjabi, DJs and dance sets all day.
- Street food stalls: Samosas, biryani, chaat, and sweet lassi (prices are festival-high, but legit tasty).
- Packed dance floor: Lots of energy, but also chill spaces to sit and eat.
- Super-friendly crowd: Go with friends, or make some there.

**Tip:** Book tickets in advance—festivals in Amsterdam often sell out, and last-minute prices spike.

## Downtown Amsterdam — Canals, Bikes & Cafés

Amsterdam’s city centre is as scenic as it looks online.
- **Canal tour:** Don’t skip this. Best way to see the city is from the water—short (1hr) cruises run from Centraal station every 15 minutes.
- **Bikes:** Rent one if you’re brave; otherwise, walking works fine. The cycle lanes are busy and locals ride fast.
- **Dam Square:** Historic, busy, and full of shops and museums.
- **Jordaan & De 9 Straatjes:** Trendy areas with boutique shops, art galleries, and quiet cafés.
- **“Coffee shops”:** These are for cannabis, not lattes! Regular cafés are everywhere, but double check the sign.

## Rotterdam — Modern City, Classic Boat Ride

Rotterdam is less touristy and a lot more modern—lots of glass, cool bridges, and striking architecture.
- **Erasmus Bridge:** Iconic for photos, and the skyline views at sunset are underrated.
- **Markthal:** Huge indoor food market—try Dutch stroopwafels or Indonesian rijsttafel (colonial influence).
- **Boat tour:** The classic way to see Rotterdam is a **harbour cruise**—you get a full view of the city’s architecture, port, and river traffic.
- **Cube Houses:** Famous yellow tilted houses—worth a walk-by and photo.

:::tip Boat Tour Tip
The Spido harbour boat tour is the easiest and most popular. Book online or grab a ticket at the dock (departs near the Erasmus Bridge).

## Food — What to Try

- **Dutch pancakes** (Pannenkoeken): Bigger than a plate, sweet or savoury, best eaten at local pancake houses.
- **Stroopwafels:** Thin waffle sandwich with caramel, best when warm.
- **Surinamese & Indonesian food:** Hidden gems, especially in Amsterdam—reflecting Dutch colonial history.
- **Herring**: If you’re adventurous, try the raw herring at a street stand. Locals eat it with onions and pickles.
- **Fries with mayo:** Dutch fries (patat) are crispy and come in paper cones—go wild with the sauces.

## Practical Tips

:::info Quick Guide
- **Transport:** Get an OV-chipkaart for trams, buses, and trains. Trains between cities are fast and run often.
- **Cashless:** Almost everywhere is card-friendly, even tiny cafés.
- **Bikes:** Give way to cyclists—they won’t stop.
- **Language:** English is widely spoken; signs are usually in Dutch and English.
- **Weather:** Changeable, even in summer—bring a light rain jacket.
- **Accommodations:** Hotels and Airbnbs book up fast for festivals—plan early.

## Final Thoughts

Amsterdam has postcard charm but doesn’t feel tourist-trappy if you venture beyond Dam Square. Rotterdam is different—modern, energetic, and less crowded, worth the quick train ride. Mirchi Fest was the highlight: incredible music, food, and a reminder of how global Desi culture is now. Next time, I’d stay longer, rent a bike, and eat even more pancakes.
