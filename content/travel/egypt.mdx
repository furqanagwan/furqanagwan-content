# Sharm El Sheikh Travel Notes: Resort Life, Red Sea, and Realities

Sharm El Sheikh is Egypt’s premier beach resort for a reason: endless sun, Red Sea reefs, and easy relaxation. But there’s more than just lying by the pool. Here’s a straight-up account of what to expect—resort pros and cons, food, activities, and what’s actually worth your time.

:::note First Impressions
If you want sunshine and zero stress, Sharm delivers. Landing here feels like stepping straight into holiday mode—palm trees, open-air terminals, and 30°C heat even in spring. Resorts are everywhere and service is dialed in for tourists. Security is visible but low-key.

## Resort Life — The Good, The Bad, The Lazy

Most people stay in **all-inclusive resorts**—for good reason. The best ones (think Rixos, Savoy, Sunrise, Baron) are massive, with multiple pools, private beaches, all-day buffets, and packed activity schedules. Staff are friendly, but tipping goes a long way.
The main trade-off? You can easily spend the whole week inside the resort bubble. It’s ultra-safe, but not very “Egyptian.” Leave the grounds to see something real.

**Resort tips:**
- **Get a room close to the beach/pool** if you can—some properties are huge.
- **Book spa or massage slots early**, especially on weekends.
- **Check if your resort includes reef access**—some have private snorkeling jetties.

## Red Sea Snorkeling & Diving — Why You’re Really Here

This is what makes Sharm special. The coral reefs are world-class—just steps from shore.
Even if you’re not a diver, get a mask and snorkel (or join a boat trip). The colors, the fish, the sheer amount of life—unreal.

- **Ras Mohammed National Park:** Egypt’s top spot for coral and marine life. You can book a half-day boat tour or access some reefs from the beach.
- **Tiran Island:** Further out, great for scuba and larger fish, including the occasional dolphin sighting.
- **House reefs:** Most resorts have their own jetty for direct reef access (bring water shoes—coral can be sharp).

:::tip Don’t-Miss Experience
If you do one thing, take a guided boat tour (snorkeling or diving) to Ras Mohammed. Lunch on the boat, crystal-clear water, and reefs that feel totally wild.

## Food — Buffets, Local Eats, and What’s Worth It

All-inclusives mean buffet overload: grilled meats, salads, fresh bread, pastries, lots of rice, and tons of desserts.
**Highlights:**
- **Grilled fish and kofta** — fresh, flavourful, cooked in front of you.
- **Tahini, hummus, baba ghanoush** — local dips on repeat.
- **Desserts** — honey-drenched baklava, basbousa, rice pudding.
- **Fresh fruit** — melon and dates stand out.

Off-resort, try:
- **Fares Seafood** — best for a proper seafood feast.
- **El Masrien** — local grill, classic Egyptian fare.
- **Naama Bay Street food** — falafel, shawarma, sugarcane juice.

## Activities — Beyond the Pool

- **Quad biking in the desert:** Adrenaline rush + sunset views, short trip from most hotels.
- **Stargazing & Bedouin dinner:** Dune-side dinner under the stars, usually with a short camel ride.
- **Glass-bottom boat:** See reefs without getting wet, good for kids or non-swimmers.
- **Naama Bay & Soho Square:** Lively promenades for evening walks, shops, and open-air shisha.

## Practical Tips

:::info Quick Guide
- **Airport transfers** are fast—most resorts are 10–20 mins from SSH airport.
- **Tipping is expected** (small change for porters, cleaning, and restaurant staff).
- **Wi-Fi** can be spotty—SIM cards are cheap and easy at the airport.
- **Currency:** Egyptian Pound (EGP). Cash for taxis and tips, card OK for most other spends.
- **Dress code:** Resorts are relaxed, but cover up for the airport and town trips.
- **Weather:** Hot and dry all year—bring sunblock, hat, and a long-sleeve shirt for sun.

## Final Thoughts

Sharm is built for relaxation and Red Sea adventure—think sun, food, and the easiest snorkeling you’ll ever do. Don’t expect deep Egyptian history or city life here: it’s a bubble, but a comfortable one. Take at least a day to get off-resort, see the reefs, and try real Egyptian food.
