# furqanagwan-content

This repo is the **single source of truth** for all the content and images powering my personal site, [`furqanagwan`](https://github.com/furqanagwan/furqanagwan).

- **Blog posts** are written in MDX and organized in the `content/` folder by category.
- **Images and media** used in posts are stored alongside the relevant articles or in dedicated image folders.

## How it works

- This repo is **not a standalone website**; itâ€™s a content hub used by my main Next.js site.
- Blog content is fetched at build or request time via the GitHub API. No local editing needed!
- Media assets are also referenced directly from this repoâ€”easy version control and instant updates.

## Why this exists

I wanted a clean separation between my siteâ€™s code and its contentâ€”like a DIY headless CMS, but simpler and cheaper.

If youâ€™re snooping around, feel free to borrow this pattern for your own projects!  
Just donâ€™t hotlink my breakfast recipes. ðŸ˜‰
